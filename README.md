## Overview
In this project, I explore several distinct approaches for forecasting key balance sheet components, including total assets, total liabilities, and shareholder equity.

Firstly, inspired by the methods of Velez-Pareja (from the paper provided by the project), I develop a rule-based average method that utilizes historical averages to predict future values, providing a simple yet interpretable baseline. Secondly, I implement a machine learning method, employing linear regression to directly forecast key balance sheet items without decomposition. Lastly, I explore a deep learning approach, incorporating a sequence-to-sequence neural network for time-series predictions.  

These methods are evaluated on real-world quarterly balance sheet data, comparing their prediction accuracy, adherence to the accounting equation, and computational efficiency. My findings provide a comprehensive assessment of the performance of different approaches in financial forecasting, highlighting the limitations of each method and offering insights into building more accurate and reliable predictive models.
